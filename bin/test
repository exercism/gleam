# Synopsis:
# Test the track's exercises.
# 
# At a minimum, this file must check if the example/exemplar solution of each 
# Practice/Concept Exercise passes the exercise's tests.
#
# To check this, you usually have to (temporarily) replace the exercise's solution files
# with its exemplar/example files.
#
# If your track uses skipped tests, make sure to (temporarily) enable these tests
# before running the tests.
#
# The path to the solution/example/exemplar files can be found in the exercise's
# .meta/config.json file, or possibly inferred from the exercise's directory name.

# Example:
# ./bin/test
# ./bin/test practice/the-slug-of-my-practice-exercise
