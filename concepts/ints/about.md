# About

There are two different kinds of numbers in Gleam - ints and floats.

Ints are whole numbers.

```gleam
let integer = 3
# -> 3
```

Gleam has several operators that work with ints.

```gleam
1 + 1 // -> 2
5 - 1 // -> 4
5 / 2 // -> 2
3 * 3 // -> 9
5 % 2 // -> 1

2 > 1  // -> True
2 < 1  // -> False
2 >= 1 // -> True
2 <= 1 // -> False
```
