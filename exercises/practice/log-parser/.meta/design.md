# Design

We assume that the student already knows basic regular expressions. The goal of this exercise is to teach them Gleam-specific details only.

## Learning objectives

- Know about the `gleam/regexp` module.
- Know about modifiers (e.g. unicode, case-insensitive).

## Out of scope

- Teaching the syntax of regular expressions.

## Prerequisites

- `strings`
- `options`

## Concepts

## Analyzer

- Ensure all functions use the `gleam/regexp` module.
