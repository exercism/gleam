# Hints

## 1. Convert locations

- Elements can be accessed from a tuple using pattern matching or indexing.

## 2. Compare treasure and place locations

- Tuples can be compared for equality if they have the same length and the same types in the same order.

## 3. Count treasure locations

- The `filter` function from the `gleam/list` module can be used to remove elements from a list based on a function that returns a bool.
