# Hints

## 5. Replace the coach

- The record update syntax can be used to create a copy of a record but with one or more fields having a new value.

## 6. Check for same team

- Records have built-in structural equality, which means that records that have the same values are equal.

## 7. Check if you should root for a team

- The best way to execute logic based on the team's value is to use a case expression.
- If you want to add a condition to a pattern, you can use a guard.
- Pattern matching works for records within records.
