# Design

## Learning objectives

- Know what a variable is.
- Know how to define a module function.
- Know how to define a function with arguments.
- Know how to return a value from a function.
- Know what a bool is.
- Know how to use logical operators on booleans.
  - `&&`, `||`, `!`

## Out of scope

- Pattern matching flow control.
- `gleam/bool` module.
- Bools as Erlang atoms.

## Prerequisites

- `basics`: needs to be able to define named functions, return values

## Concepts

- `bools` know of the existence of the `Bool` type and its two values, boolean operators, and how to build boolean logical expressions, and know boolean operator precedence rules.
