## Concepts

- `basics`: know what a variable is; know how to define a variable; know how to update a variable; know how to add type annotations for variables; know how to define a function; know how to return a value from a function; know how to call a function; how to define an integer; know how to define a string; know how to use mathematical operators on integers; know how to define comments.

## Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites.

## Analyzer

This exercise could benefit from the following rules added to the [analyzer][analyzer]:

- Verify that the `remaining_minutes_in_oven` function calls the `expected_minutes_in_oven` function.
- Verify that the `total_time_in_minutes` function calls the `preparation_time_in_minutes` function.
