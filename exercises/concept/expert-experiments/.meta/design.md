# Design

## Learning objectives

- Know about use expressions.
- Know they can be used to avoid indentation.
- Know they can be used with any function that takes a function as a final argument.

## Out of scope

- Use expressions are block scoped, not function scoped like similar constructs in other languages.
- Use with JavaScript promises.

## Concepts

- `use-expressions`

## Prerequisites

- `results`
- `anonymous-functions`

## Analyzer

This exercise could benefit from the following rules added to the [analyzer][analyzer]:

- Verify that the `run_experiment` function uses `use` expressions.
