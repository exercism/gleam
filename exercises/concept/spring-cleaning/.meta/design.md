# Design

## Learning objectives

- Know what let assertions are.
- Know that the program will panic if they do not match.
- Know that libraries should not use let assertions.

## Out of scope

- Panic recovery.

## Concepts

- `let-assertions`

## Prerequisites

- `results`
- `strings`
- `lists`

## Analyzer

This exercise could benefit from the following rules added to the [analyzer][analyzer]:
